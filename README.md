As the name implies, it is a downloader for [mangadex.org](mangadex). I know, there are a bunch of such programs already, but this one emerged from my particular needs.

## Instalation

Should be as strainghtforward as running the included binary as:
`mdex <url> `

Also Optional arguments:
 - --sc <start-chapter> 
 - --ec <end-chapter> 
 - --ds <for data saver>
 - --lang <language>
